    "There are a couple of things here to dissect. Many languages need braces `{}`, brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` to draw boundaries around the argument of the `if` statement, or the body. In Python, symbols are reduced in favour of words and spaces, for readability. To achieve the same effect, Python separates the condition from the body with the colon `:` and the indentation (four spaces, by convention)\n",

    "However, indentation (whitespace at the start of a line) does. It is an extremely visually clear way to show where blocks of code, like the body of this `if` statement, start and end. For scientists, it forces a very good programming practice - basic code style - your code doesn't run without if it isn't visually clear (well... neatly indented). One of the reasons I got into Python was that my PhD C++ code was so unreadable, dodgily indented and unwieldy, it was easier to rewrite in Python than try and extend it - once I had modification was easy, I could see how everything was laid out, where functions started and ended, before even reading a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that you can print with `print`. Here we are running Python3, the latest version. If you've played with Python2, you will notice this syntax is a bit different - it has parentheses (aka. parens) around the argument. A whole raft of changes came in with Python3 and, like XP, Python2 will be around for some time to come through sheer momentum. However by 2018, almost all important libraries are now Python3-ready and I, for one, develop new software in Python3 only, where possible. Good porting tools exist for moving old code.\n",

If you want to get an integer (that is, whatever the float answer is with the decimal chopped off), you can use double-slash. Try removing the second slash and re-running to see the exact non-integer answer. In Python2, using one slash *always* gives an integer, unless you cast the bottom or top to a float (as in C, say)."

If you check first (`if \"something\" in thingy:`), either the answer is misleading (\"no\"), or what looks like an innocent if-clause is modifying your dictionary. Moreover, even for an ordinary dictionary, having an if-clause followed by a retrieval hits your dictionary scan twice - try-catch only searches once."

The answer is usually that exceptions are horrendously slow and inefficient. In Python this isn't true, by design. They are so fundamental to the language that every loop in fact ends, not with a failing test, but when the iterable throws a specific exception (the `StopIteration` exception)."
